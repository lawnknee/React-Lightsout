Component Design

App
As often, this is a very simple component. It just renders the Board component.

Board
The most sophisticated component. It will hold the state that represents the in-memory grid of true/false for lights-on/off. Since the state for the board lives here, this is also were the setState() calls will need to go — and therefore, the functions that call setState().

Cell
A simpler component. This will simply render a <div>, where the CSS classes will indicate whether this cell is lit or unlit. This is what the user clicks on — but it will need to call a function it receives from the Board, since that will need to update the state.

function changePosition(i) {
    setCircles(circles => {
      // create copy of state array
      const circlesCopy = [...circles];
      // create copy of object at idx i,
      // then change copy
      circlesCopy[i] = {
        ...circles[i],
        x: randRange(),
        y: randRange(),
      };
      // return circlesCopy;
      return circlesCopy;
    });
  }
